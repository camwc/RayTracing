# Raytracer
___
A simple ray tracer I wrote in java to learn the basic concepts

### Features
* Camera focal length and depth of field adjustments
* Supports reflective refractive and matte materials
* Abstract bounding box hierarchy for hit detection

Writes .ppm files

I used https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html and https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html as a reference
